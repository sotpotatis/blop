### an HTML-like to raw string converter
skipper converts HTML-like documents to raw strings and/or classes that can be directly converted to raw strings.

this is done using a toolkit of converters as well as a "Screen" concept. 

skipper also includes a source loader that can load content from a filesystem or from HTTP/HTTPS.
